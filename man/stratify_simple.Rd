\usage{
stratify_simple(
  tblList = NULL,
  df = NULL,
  towDist_NM = 1.75,
  areaField = "AREA_KM2",
  areaFieldUnits = c("KM2", "NM2"),
  debug = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tblList}{the default is \code{NULL}. A list of RV dataframes. If provided, data will be flattened using easyFlatten.}

\item{df}{the default is \code{NULL}. A data frame containing pre-flattened RV data. Used if tblList is NULL.}

\item{towDist_NM}{the default is \code{1.75}. The standard tow distance in nautical miles used for standardization.}

\item{areaField}{the default is \code{"AREA_KM2"}. The name of the field containing area values.}

\item{areaFieldUnits}{the default is \code{c("KM2","NM2")}. The units of the area field. Must be either "KM2" or "NM2".}

\item{debug}{the default is \code{FALSE}. If TRUE, additional diagnostic information is printed.}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements: stratified_bySet (set-level calculations), stratified_byStrat (strata-level summaries), and OVERALL_SUMMARY (overall statistics with confidence intervals).
}
\description{
Calculate stratified estimates of biomass and abundance from RV survey data. This function handles taxa-level or species-level data without detailed length/age information. It standardizes catches to a common tow distance, calculates per-unit-area densities, and generates stratified and overall summary statistics with confidence intervals.
}
\note{
This function should be used for taxa-level data or when GSDET has no records. For species-level data with length/age information, use stratify_detailed() instead.
