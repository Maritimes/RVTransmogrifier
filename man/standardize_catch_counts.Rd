\usage{
standardize_catch_counts(tblList, towDist = 1.75, by_sex = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tblList}{the default is \code{NULL}. A list of RV dataframes including GSCAT, GSDET, and GSINF.}

\item{towDist}{the default is \code{1.75}. The standard tow distance in nautical miles used for standardization.}

\item{by_sex}{the default is \code{FALSE}. If TRUE, calculations are grouped by sex (FSEX) in addition to other grouping variables.}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements: standardized_data (individual-level records), length_total (aggregated by length), and age_total (aggregated by age). Returns NA for length_total or age_total if no length or age data exist.
}
\description{
Standardize catch counts from detailed length/age data (GSDET) by applying weight ratios, correcting for tow distance, and calculating density per square kilometer. Returns standardized data at the individual level as well as aggregated totals by length and age.
